## My process

Sketching at first on paper, trying to get the HTML5 structure in place. 
Used the design system from Figma to setup my variables.
Then - coding  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have never used variables in simple CSS - only while using SCSS. So although this is a simple task, I am already learning.
Also only recently used clamp for responsive font in WordPress. First time using it in a coding project. 

### Continued development

I still need to be more secure about how to make the right decisions in my structure and styling.
